## Projects

### Server Administration and Networking
- Network File Share (NFS) created and mounted permanently to the Client Machine
- Ext4, xfs filesystem resized and Corrupt FileSystem Repaired
- Designed an isolated network domain with its own internal routing, IP Addressing (DHCP), DNS resolution (including reverse DNS lookup), firewalling (UFW) with DHCP/DNS and DMZ segmentation that hosts Web service using Nginx
- Configured NAT Forwarding (Masquerade) to securely forward internal default traffic to external internet
- Added firewall rules that help the router to make routing decisions for the traffic flowing through
- Storage Created using Dummy Disk, made it block device, created partitions and assigning the filesystem and finally wrote data to it
- LUKS Encryption Added to Created Dummy Disk, and simulated the System Boot Lockout, troubleshooted and successfully logged back into the System

### Backup & Data Management
- Designed and implemented full, incremental, and remote backups using rsync
- Backup Service scheduled with cron jobs task list

### Networking Projects (Cisco / CCNA-Level)
- Designed and implemented enterprise-style networks including campus, banking, hospital, VOIP, and hotel systems
- Configured VLANs, Layer2 and Layer3 Switching, inter-VLAN routing, OSPF routing, DHCP Snooping, and Wireless LAN Controllers
- Successfully Completed CCNA Mega Lab with 95% score (Instructor: David Bombal)

### Service Hosting & systemd
- Built LAMP stack with Database Backend for Application Data Storage and hosted WordPress on nginx
- Created and Managed custom systemd services
- Remote System monitored using monit tool. SSH connection established and the performance output shown with Port Forwarding

### Containers and Orchestration
- Deployed Flask and Django Application using Docker on AWS EC2 instances
- Configured Docker Networking, Docker Volumes and most importantly, Docker Data Persistence
- Three-tier Application Deployed on AWS EC2 with associated static Elastic IP, Security Groups, on Kubernetes’ K3 cluster that continuously integrates and continuously deploys (CICD) from Github Webhooks that trigger Jenkins build using Jenkinsfile

### HomeLab (Linux and Virtualization)
- Built and maintaining a Linux homelab using Proxmox VE on Dedicated Machine
- Migrated Linux VMs, from initial Microsoft Hyper-V setup to Proxmox with full data and configuration retention
- Used homelab for Linux Administration, Backups, Testing, and local projects
